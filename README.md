# BOUNTI dApp x Byont Labs

### The following README further outlines the Bounti Project created by an OPEN FHICT Team consisting of (Luc Jonkers, Vitali Bestolkau, Dante Geroge, Furkan Öztürk, Ignas Apšega)


Bounti is a fully decentralised on-chain dApp created with the intention of providing DAO users with a modern solution to manage the communication and coordination between themselves and one or more DAOs on the daily basis. Bounti does this by allowing users to interact with Tasks, Votes and Proposals created by the DAOs they are a member of. Therefore each user has complete control and oversight of their daily expectations, daily work and daily participation without the stress and clutter of other industry standards such as Discord or Telegram.
